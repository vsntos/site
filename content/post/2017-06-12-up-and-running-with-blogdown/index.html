<p>Objetivo: analisar o tamanho e características empréstimos e subsídios Chineses, notadamente, na América do Sul entre 2000 - 2014.</p>
<p>Desafio: we find that 50% of China’s lending to developing countries is not reported to the IMF or World Bank. (HORN; REINHART.; TREBESCH, 2015:7).</p>

<p>Dreher, A., Fuchs, A., Parks, B.C., Strange, A. M., &amp; Tierney, M. J. (2017). Aid, China, and Growth: Evidence from a New Global Development Finance Dataset. AidData Working Paper #46. Williamsburg, VA: AidData.</p>
<p>"This dataset tracks the known universe of overseas Chinese official finance including foreign aid and other forms of concessional and non-concessional state financing — from China to 138 countries between 2000 and 2014.</p>
<p>Apresentaremos os dados sob a forma de <em>estatística descritiva</em> e mobilizaremos algumas medidas de <em>Análise de Redes</em>.</p>
<p>First, let’s load the packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dados_cross_bid &lt;- here(&quot;static/files/dados.cross.csv&quot;) %&gt;% 
  read_csv()

dados_GCOF &lt;- here(&quot;static/files/GlobalChineseOfficialFinanceDataset_v1.0.xlsx&quot;) %&gt;% 
  read_xlsx()</code></pre>
<p>Do total das 5466 observações salienta-se que 4235 projetos (77.48%) não tem identificação da origem do financiamento sob o rótulo <em>Unspecified Chinese Government Institution</em>. No entanto, dos projetos que a origem dos recursos podem ser identificados três stakeholders podem ser destacados: Export-Import Bank of China (765), China Development Bank (208), e Chinese Embassy/Consulate (71). O gráfico 1 apresenta o conjunto de entidades que financiaram acima de 5 projetos.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t &lt;-table(dados_GCOF$funding_agency_1)

 theme_classic(base_size = 10)</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A mesma dificuldade de rastreamento ocorre para a identificação dos implementadores sendo possível nomeá-los em apenas 1409 projetos. O Gráfico 2 apresenta esses resultados.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t2 &lt;-table(dados_GCOF$implementing_agency_1)

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Cabe considerar que, consideradas apenas as operações sem identificação de financiamento, ao rastrear os stakeholders implementadores dos projetos destacamos: i) Confucius Institute (31), ii) Shanghai Construction Group General Co (22) e iii) Chinese Embassy (20). A tabela 1 informa quais atores que mais implementaram projetos na categoria dos financiamentos não passíveis de rastreamento.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t3 &lt;- dados_GCOF %&gt;%
